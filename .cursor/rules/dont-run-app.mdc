description: Do not run npm scripts that start servers or build processes
alwaysApply: true

**CRITICAL: Do not run these commands through the AI:**

- `npm run dev` - Do not start the development server
- `npm run start` - Do not start the production server  
- `npm run build` - Do not run the build process

These commands should only be run by the user manually in their terminal. The AI should not execute server processes, build processes, or any long-running commands that would interfere with the user's development workflow.

**Allowed commands:**
- `npm install` - Installing dependencies is fine
- `npm run type-check` - Type checking is fine
- File operations, reading, writing, searching
- One-time utility commands that complete quickly

**Why:** Running servers through AI can cause port conflicts, interfere with the user's active development, and create confusion about which processes are running.
